Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    number n = 9;
    number m = 0;

    reaction r = D'OH;
    reaction d = WOOHOO;

    number a = 3 + 3;
    reaction b = 3 is 3;

    number p = (3 + 3);
    number q = (3 + 3) - 4;

    reaction x = (D'OH xor WOOHOO) or WOOHOO;
    number y = (4 * 9) is not 5;
    number z = -1;
    reaction xx = not WOOHOO;
    reaction yy = not not D'OH;
