Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    number n = 3;
    bignumber b = 123a;             Marge: wrong declaration, gives 1 error: letter behind the number;

    symbol symbol c = 'c';          Marge: Cannot use type as ID, gives 1 error.;

    (a = 5) eh? {                   Marge: wrong equality test, token for equality is 'is';
        b = 21;
    } nope {
        marge: wrong comment;       Marge: Wrong comment, 'marge' has to start with a capital letter M.
                                           Gives 2 errors because parser thinks it is a declaration;
    }




} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
