Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    reaction d = D'OH;
    reaction w = WOOHOO;

    d = not d;
    w = not w;

    d = not d;
    w = not w;

    d = d is d;
    w = w is not w;

    d = 3 > 1;
    w = 3 < 1;

    number n = 1;

    d = 3 > n;
    w = 3 < n;

    d = n is n;
    w = n is not n;

    d = 3 >= 3;
    w = 3 <= 5;

    d = not (D'OH);
    w = not (3 > 4);

    d = D'OH xor WOOHOO;
    w = WOOHOO and WOOHOO;
    d = WOOHOO or D'OH;

    reaction p = not D'OH
    reaction q = D'OH xor WOOHOO;

    p = D'OH xor D'OH xor WOOHOO;
    q = WOOHOO and WOOHOO or D'OH;

} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
