Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    number n = 0;
    number m;
    number p = n + 1;

    p = p + p;
    p = (p + p);
    p = (p + (p + p));

    m = p - p;
    n = 1 * m;

    n = 4;
    n = -n;

    n = n * 2 * 3 + 2;

    number r1 = p;
    number r2 = n;
    number r3 = 0;
    number r4 = 4 + 4;
    number r5 = (4 - 1) * (3 + 3);
    number r6 = 6 - 3 * 2;
    number r7 = -2;

} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
