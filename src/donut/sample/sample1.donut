Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    number n = 3;           Marge: number 3
    number num = 5;         Marge: number 5
    number res;             Marge: number result

    if (n + num is not 8 and ) {
        n = 5
        Marge: do something
    } elif {
        Marge: something else;
    } else {
        Marge: something else
    }
} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
