Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    reaction good = WOOHOO;
    reaction bad = D'OH;

    number n;

    if (bad) {
        n = 10;
    } else {
        n = -10;
        if (n is 0)   {
            Marge: I'llshowyou "No";
        } elif (WOOHOO)   {
            Marge: I'llshowyou "WHY YOU LITTLE ARHSGSHDFJKSDF";
        } else {
            Marge: Dead code!
        }
    }

    reaction r = WOOHOO and D'OH or D'OH;
    reaction b = r xor D'OH;

    r = r is not b;
    reaction notr = not r;

    if (notr)   {
        Marge: I'llshowyou "Done";
    }
} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
