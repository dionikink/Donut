Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    number n = 5;
    number n2 = 4;
    reaction ohoh = WOOHOO;

    if (n + n2 is 9) {
        n2 = 7;
    } else {
        n = 2;
    }

    if (3 + n is n + 5) {
        n = 9
    } elif (ohoh) {
        ohoh = D'OH
    } else {
        n = n + n2
    }

} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
