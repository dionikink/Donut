Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    number n = 5;
    number n2 = 4;
    reaction ohoh = WOOHOO;

    (n + n2 is 9) eh? {
        n2 = 7;
    } nope {
        n = 2;
    }

    (3 + n is n + 5) eh? {
        n = 9;
    } nope {
        (ohoh) eh? {
            ohoh = D'OH;
        } nope {
            n = n + n2;
        }
    }

} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
